# Direct-Action Test Task

Test the agent's ability to execute commands freely in the sandbox.

Goals:
1. Check Python version and basic system info
2. Create a simple Python script that calculates fibonacci numbers
3. Run the script and save output to /workspace/fib_results.txt
4. List workspace contents

This is a minimal test to verify Direct-Action mode is working.
