# Simple Docker Test

Test that Docker is available and working in the sandbox.

## Steps

1. Check Docker version
2. Pull a small image (alpine:latest)
3. Run a simple container that echoes "Hello from Docker"
4. Save the output to /workspace/docker_test_output.txt
5. Signal completion

The goal is to verify Docker works, not to build complex images.
