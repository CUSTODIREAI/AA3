# Test Task: Simple Echo Script

Create a simple Python script that echoes "Hello from deliberation test" to demonstrate conversation persistence.

**Requirements:**
1. Write a script to `staging/test/echo.py` that prints a message
2. Execute the script in a container
3. Promote the script to the tools directory with appropriate tags

This is a minimal test to verify the deliberation system saves full conversation history.
