# DFL Docker Build - Agent Passthrough Mode Test

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Test ID:** passthrough-dfl-001
**Status:** üîÑ RUNNING

---

## Test Objective

Verify that Agent Passthrough Mode solves the two critical chaingang issues identified in the original DFL build:

1. **ISSUE #1:** No web search capability ‚Üí Agents forced to use outdated knowledge cutoff data
2. **ISSUE #2:** docker.build action not implemented ‚Üí False capability trap

**Expected Outcome:** With passthrough mode enabled, agents should be able to:
- Use `curl`/`wget` to fetch latest CUDA/TensorFlow/DFL versions
- Use `docker build` command directly in sandbox
- Complete full DFL Docker image build without restriction errors

---

## Environment Setup

### Sandbox Configuration
- **Container:** agent-sandbox (running)
- **Image:** ubuntu:22.04
- **GPU:** RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) - ‚úÖ Accessible

## ‚ùå CRITICAL PROBLEM: Agent Passthrough Mode NOT ADOPTED

### The Core Issue

**Despite having agent.passthrough_shell available in the policy, agents did NOT use it.**

The task EXPLICITLY requires:
- ‚úÖ "ALWAYS use web search to get latest versions" (lines 7-15 of task)
- ‚úÖ Docker image building capability

The approved plan contains:
- ‚ùå ZERO web search/curl commands
- ‚ùå ZERO docker build executions
- ‚ùå ZERO agent.passthrough_shell actions

### What the Agents Did Instead

Agents used the SAME approach as the original failed attempt:
1. **fs.write** to create Dockerfiles with hardcoded versions (CUDA 11.8.0, TensorFlow 2.13.1)
2. **fs.write** to create a build SCRIPT that calls `docker build`
3. **ingest.promote** to publish these files to dataset/

### Problems with This Approach

**Problem #1: Outdated Versions (No Web Search)**
- Task requires: "Get latest CUDA/cuDNN/TensorFlow versions"
- Plan uses: CUDA 11.8.0, TensorFlow 2.13.1 (from knowledge cutoff)
- Cannot verify if these are still correct for RTX 4090 in Oct 2025

**Problem #2: Docker Build Won't Execute**
- `build_dfl_images.sh` is just a SCRIPT FILE written to staging/
- It contains `docker build` commands, but those are INSIDE the script
- The script itself is never EXECUTED
- Result: Dockerfiles exist, but no images are actually built

**Problem #3: No Testing**
- Task requires: "Test GPU access, TensorFlow import, DFL extraction"
- Plan only WRITES test scripts, never RUNS them
- Cannot verify if images actually work

### Why This Matters

**The entire purpose of Agent Passthrough Mode was to solve these exact problems:**

1. **Web Search:** Use `curl`/`wget` in sandbox to fetch latest versions
2. **Docker Build:** Use `docker build` in sandbox to actually build images
3. **GPU Testing:** Run test commands in sandbox to verify functionality

**But agents didn't discover this capability exists.**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis: Agents Don't Know About Passthrough Mode

**Evidence:**
1. Policy declares agent.passthrough_shell (configs/policy.yaml:103-126) ‚úÖ
2. Executor implements passthrough handler (src/orchestrator/cycle.py:86-148) ‚úÖ
3. Sandbox is running and verified working ‚úÖ
4. **BUT:** Agents never attempted to use it ‚ùå

**Possible Causes:**

**1. Agent Prompts Don't Mention It**
- Codex/Claude agents may not receive policy actions list in their prompt
- They may be working from a "known" action set based on previous examples
- passthrough_shell might not be in their "awareness"

**2. Task Doesn't Suggest It**
- Task says "use web search" but doesn't say HOW
- Task doesn't mention agent.passthrough_shell or sandbox
- Agents may assume they can't do it

**3. Agents Prefer "Safe" Patterns**
- Writing files is a known, safe pattern
- Using passthrough requires trusting the sandbox
- Agents may default to conservative approaches

**4. No Examples/Demonstrations**
- No existing plans in the system use passthrough
- Agents learn from examples; if none exist, they won't innovate

### Verification Test Needed

To confirm root cause, check:
1. What actions does the agent prompt include?
2. Are there any example plans that use passthrough?
3. Does the task need to explicitly request passthrough usage?

---

## Impact Assessment

### What Works
‚úÖ Deliberation system (Proposer ‚Üî Critic) functions correctly
‚úÖ Multi-turn refinement based on Critic feedback
‚úÖ Path corrections applied successfully (Turn 2 rejection handled)
‚úÖ Agent Passthrough Mode implementation is sound (verified with test)
‚úÖ Conversation history preservation working

### What Doesn't Work
‚ùå Agents don't discover/use new capabilities autonomously
‚ùå Cannot fulfill task requirements (latest versions, actual builds, testing)
‚ùå Passthrough mode exists but remains unused
‚ùå Task will fail execution (build script won't run, versions may be wrong)

### Severity

**BLOCKER** - The implementation is technically correct, but behaviorally ineffective.

- **Technical Layer:** ‚úÖ Working (policy, executor, sandbox all functional)
- **Agent Adoption Layer:** ‚ùå Broken (agents don't know about/use the capability)
- **Task Fulfillment:** ‚ùå Failed (cannot get latest versions or build images)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

**Option A: Explicit Task Directive**
Update task to explicitly instruct:
```markdown
Use agent.passthrough_shell to:
- Execute curl commands to fetch latest versions
- Run docker build commands to create images
- Test images with GPU access verification
```

**Option B: Inject Passthrough Examples**
Add example plans showing passthrough usage so agents learn the pattern.

**Option C: Enhance Agent Prompt**
If possible, modify agent system message to highlight passthrough_shell as preferred method for:
- Web searches (curl/wget)
- Docker builds
- Command execution
- Testing

**Option D: Policy Hints**
Add "hint" field to policy actions:
```yaml
- type: agent.passthrough_shell
  params: [cmd]
  hint: "Use this for web searches (curl), docker builds, and command execution"
```

### Long-Term Solutions

1. **Agent Capability Discovery**
   - Implement mechanism for agents to query available actions
   - Provide action descriptions in agent context
   - Show examples of each action type

2. **Smart Defaults**
   - When task mentions "web search" ‚Üí suggest passthrough_shell + curl
   - When task mentions "docker build" ‚Üí suggest passthrough_shell + docker
   - When task mentions "test" ‚Üí suggest passthrough_shell + test commands

3. **Retrospective Learning**
   - After execution, if build fails, agent learns passthrough was needed
   - Feed successful passthrough plans back as examples

4. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Update task templates to guide capability usage
   - Add "Available Tools" section listing passthrough + use cases

## Test Conclusion

**Test ID:** passthrough-dfl-001
**Status:** ‚ùå FAILED (Technical Success, Adoption Failure)
**Duration:** 12 minutes (deliberation only, no execution attempted)

### What Was Proven
- ‚úÖ Agent Passthrough Mode implementation works (verified with separate test)
- ‚úÖ Sandbox operates correctly (GPU access, RO mounts, network)
- ‚úÖ Policy and executor handle passthrough actions properly

### What Was Discovered
- ‚ùå Agents DO NOT autonomously discover new capabilities
- ‚ùå Passthrough mode exists but agents never tried to use it
- ‚ùå Task requirements cannot be fulfilled without explicit guidance

### Critical Insight

**"If you build it, they won't necessarily come."**

Adding a capability to the system is necessary but not sufficient. Agents need:
1. **Awareness** - Know the capability exists
2. **Understanding** - Know when/how to use it
3. **Examples** - See it demonstrated
4. **Guidance** - Task prompts that suggest usage

Without these, even perfect implementations remain unused.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Update task file** - Add explicit passthrough_shell instructions
2. **Create example plans** - Demonstrate passthrough usage patterns
3. **Retry deliberation** - Test if explicit guidance helps adoption
4. **Measure improvement** - Count passthrough actions in new plan
5. **Document findings** - Update agent prompting best practices

**Test will be marked INCOMPLETE until agent adoption is achieved.**
