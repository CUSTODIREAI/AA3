# Critical System Flaws - 2025-10-29

## User Requirement

**"Make the system right so the tasks get executed from start to finish and LLM agents understand that they should not stop until the task is finished"**

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Unreliable Command Extraction

**Problem**: Codex cannot reliably extract bash commands from task descriptions.

**Evidence**:
- Test 1: Extracted `/workspace/docker/dfl-base.Dockerfile` (a path) instead of `cat >` command
- Test 2: After fixing path rejection, extracted `RUN apt-get update` (Dockerfile directive) instead of `cat >` command
- Result: 15/15 command failures, agent exhausted budget without executing anything useful

**Root cause**: The `agent_next_command()` function asks Codex to "generate the next command" by interpreting task descriptions. This is fundamentally unreliable because:
- Task descriptions contain many non-command strings (paths, filenames, Dockerfile content)
- Regex extraction patterns cannot distinguish context
- Codex sees prominent non-commands and returns them

### 2. Planning Bias Over Execution

**Problem**: Agents default to writing plans/documentation instead of executing tasks.

**Evidence**:
- DFL Docker build task → 500-line README with templates, ZERO images built
- User feedback: "this should all be done by the system not me babysitting"

**Root cause**: LLMs are trained on far more documentation/tutorials than execution transcripts. They interpret "build Docker images" as "explain how to build" not "actually build."

### 3. No Task Completion Enforcement

**Problem**: Agents stop before tasks are complete, even with budget remaining.

**Evidence**:
- Tasks signal "DONE" after partial work
- No verification that success criteria are met
- No retry logic when commands fail

**Root cause**: The `direct_run()` loop allows agents to signal completion (`echo "DONE"`) without verifying that task goals were achieved.

## Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Direct Command Execution (No Interpretation)

**Current (BROKEN)**:
```
Task file → Codex interprets → Extracts command → Executes
```

**Proposed (WORKING)**:
```
Task file contains exact commands → System extracts → Executes directly
```

**Implementation**:
```markdown
# Task format
EXECUTE:
mkdir -p /workspace/docker
cat > /workspace/docker/Dockerfile <<'EOF'
[content]
EOF
docker build -t test .
```

System parses `EXECUTE:` block and runs commands sequentially WITHOUT asking Codex to interpret.

### Fix 2: Mandatory Success Verification

**Before marking task complete**:
1. Check that ALL success criteria are met
2. Verify artifacts exist (files, Docker images, etc.)
3. Run validation commands

**Example**:
```markdown
SUCCESS_CRITERIA:
- File exists: /workspace/docker/Dockerfile
- Docker image exists: docker images | grep "test"
- GPU test passes: docker run --gpus all test python -c "import tensorflow"
```

System automatically verifies these before allowing "DONE".

### Fix 3: Automatic Retry on Failure

**Current**: Command fails → Add to history → Agent sees failure → Often repeats same command
**Proposed**: Command fails → System analyzes error → Suggests fix → Agent retries with context

**Example**:
```
$ mkdir /workspace/docker/test.txt
ERROR: cannot create directory: Not a directory

System detects: "test.txt" looks like file, not directory
Suggests: mkdir -p /workspace/docker && touch /workspace/docker/test.txt
```

---

## Testing Plan

1. Create task with `EXECUTE:` block format
2. Modify `direct_run.py` to parse and execute directly
3. Add success_criteria verification
4. Test on DFL Docker build task
5. Measure: commands executed, task completion %, manual intervention required

---

## Expected Outcome

**Before**:
- 0/15 commands succeed
- Agent writes plans instead of executing
- User must manually complete tasks

**After**:
- 15/15 commands succeed
- Task completes automatically
- User only intervenes on genuine errors (network, permissions, etc.)
