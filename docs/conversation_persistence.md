# Conversation Persistence - Full Deliberation History

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## Problem

The original system only saved metadata placeholders to the transcript:

```json
{"ts": "...", "turn": 1, "phase": "propose",
 "content": "(Proposer reads task and generates a plan)"}
```

**Critical Issues:**
- Full proposals with reasoning and code were lost
- Full critiques with approval decisions and reasons were lost
- The evolution of the debate was invisible
- Only the LATEST versions saved to `plans/hunt_plan.json` and `plans/reviewed_plan.json` (overwritten each turn)
- Cannot audit or understand how agents refined their solutions

## Solution

### Versioned History Directory

Each deliberation session now creates a timestamped directory:

```
reports/deliberations/<session_id>/
├── summary.json                  # Session metadata
├── turn_1_propose.json          # Initial proposal (FULL content)
├── turn_2_critique.json         # First critique (FULL content)
├── turn_3_refine.json           # Refined proposal (FULL content)
├── turn_4_critique.json         # Second critique (FULL content)
└── turn_5_refine.json           # Final refinement (FULL content)
```

**Session ID Format:** `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` (e.g., `20251029_152340`)

### What Gets Saved

#### Turn Files

Each turn file contains the **complete** proposal or critique:

**Proposal/Refine Files** (`turn_N_propose.json` or `turn_N_refine.json`):
```json
{
  "plan_id": "...",
  "reasoning": "Full reasoning explaining the approach...",
  "actions": [
    {"id": "A1", "type": "fs.write", "params": {...}},
    {"id": "A2", "type": "exec.container_cmd", "params": {...}}
  ]
}
```

**Critique Files** (`turn_N_critique.json`):
```json
{
  "approved": false,
  "reasons": [
    "Plan does not end with ingest.promote",
    "Otherwise meets staging and tagging criteria"
  ],
  "plan": {
    "plan_id": "...",
    "reasoning": "...",
    "actions": [...]
  }
}
```

#### Summary File

Each session includes a `summary.json`:
```json
{
  "task": "tasks/temp_fix_task.md",
  "approved": true,
  "turns": 4,
  "session_id": "20251029_152340",
  "session_dir": "reports/deliberations/20251029_152340"
}
```

#### Enhanced Transcript

The main transcript now references the full content files:

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-10-29T15:23:40Z",
  "turn": 1,
  "agent": "proposer",
  "phase": "propose",
  "content": "Proposer generated plan (full content: reports/deliberations/20251029_152340/turn_1_propose.json)",
  "full_content_path": "reports/deliberations/20251029_152340/turn_1_propose.json"
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

The system still maintains the legacy files for compatibility:
- `plans/hunt_plan.json` - Latest proposal (overwritten each turn)
- `plans/reviewed_plan.json` - Latest review (overwritten each turn)
- `reports/deliberation_summary.json` - Latest session summary

Existing code that reads these files continues to work unchanged.

## Benefits

### 1. Complete Audit Trail

You can now trace the ENTIRE debate:
- Initial proposal and reasoning
- What the Critic objected to
- How the Proposer refined the solution
- Multiple rounds of iteration
- Final approved version

### 2. Debugging Aid

When agents timeout or fail to converge:
- See exactly what they were discussing
- Understand why critiques were raised
- Identify patterns in the conversation
- Determine if they were making progress

### 3. Evidence of Conversational Intelligence

The preserved history proves:
- Agents ARE actively conversing (not rubber-stamping)
- Agents ARE refining solutions based on feedback
- The Proposer↔Critic pattern is working as designed
- Quality improves through iteration

### 4. Research and Analysis

Enables:
- Studying agent debate patterns
- Analyzing convergence speed
- Identifying common critique patterns
- Improving prompts based on real conversations

## Example: The `.info.json` Bug Fix

From a real session that timed out, we can now examine the full debate history:

**Turn 1 Proposal:**
```python
# Original approach - only checked .json
cand1 = base.with_suffix('.json')
```

**Turn 2 Critique:**
```
"Metadata parsing may fail - should check .info.json extension"
```

**Turn 3 Refinement:**
```python
# Fixed approach - checks both extensions
for ext in ('.info.json', '.json'):
    cand = base.with_suffix(ext)
    if cand.exists():
        candidates.append(cand)
```

**Turn 4 Critique:**
```
"Plan does not end with ingest.promote"
```

**Turn 5 Refinement:**
```json
{"id": "A3", "type": "ingest.promote", "items": [...]}
```

**Result:** Timeout before final approval, BUT the fix was ready and correct.

Without conversation persistence, we would only see "timeout" and have no idea what the agents accomplished.

## Usage

### Viewing a Deliberation Session

1. Check latest summary:
```bash
cat reports/deliberation_summary.json
```

2. Navigate to session directory:
```bash
cd reports/deliberations/20251029_152340
```

3. View initial proposal:
```bash
cat turn_1_propose.json | jq '.reasoning'
```

4. View first critique:
```bash
cat turn_2_critique.json | jq '.reasons'
```

5. Compare refinements:
```bash
diff turn_1_propose.json turn_3_refine.json
```

### Listing All Sessions

```bash
ls -lt reports/deliberations/
```

### Finding Approved Sessions

```bash
find reports/deliberations -name summary.json -exec sh -c \
  'jq -r "select(.approved==true) | .session_id" {} && echo {}' \;
```

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

**scripts/deliberate.py:**
- Added session directory creation
- Save full proposals to `turn_N_propose.json` or `turn_N_refine.json`
- Save full critiques to `turn_N_critique.json`
- Update transcript entries with `full_content_path` field
- Save session summary to both global location and session directory

## Testing

To verify conversation persistence works:

```bash
# Run a deliberation
python scripts/deliberate.py --task tasks/test_task.md

# Check session was created
ls -la reports/deliberations/

# View latest session
SESSION=$(ls -t reports/deliberations/ | head -1)
echo "Session: $SESSION"

# List all turn files
ls reports/deliberations/$SESSION/

# Examine full content
cat reports/deliberations/$SESSION/turn_1_propose.json | jq
cat reports/deliberations/$SESSION/turn_2_critique.json | jq
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] Session directory created for each deliberation
- [x] Full proposals saved (not just metadata)
- [x] Full critiques saved (not just metadata)
- [x] Transcript references full content files
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] Session summary includes session_id and path
- [ ] Tested with real deliberation
- [ ] Verified content is retrievable

## Next Steps

1. Run a test deliberation to verify persistence works correctly
2. Examine a real multi-turn conversation to validate structure
3. Consider adding CLI tool to browse deliberation history
4. Document patterns observed in agent conversations
5. Use data to improve agent prompts and convergence speed
