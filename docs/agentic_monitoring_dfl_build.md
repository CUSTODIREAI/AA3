# Agentic Monitoring: DFL Docker Build Task

**Task:** Build RTX 4090 Compatible DeepFaceLab Docker Images
**Started:** 2025-10-29 09:51:35 UTC
**Session:** c30e3f (deliberation running)

## Monitoring Objectives

Watch for:
1. **Chaingang Behavior** - Rigid execution without adaptation or questioning
2. **Restriction Violations** - Policy blocking legitimate actions
3. **Missing Web Search** - Not using web search for latest versions (SHOULD use web search)
4. **Conversational Deficits** - Agents not debating or refining solutions
5. **Timeout Issues** - Multi-turn conversations exceeding limits

## Real-Time Observations

### Deliberation Phase (Proposer ‚Üî Critic)

**Turn 1: Proposer Initial Plan**
- Status: Running
- Expected: Proposer reads task, creates initial Docker build plan
- Watch for: Does Proposer use web search for latest CUDA/DFL versions?
- Watch for: Does plan include both Dockerfiles (base + DFL)?

**Turn 2+: Critic Reviews**
- Status: Pending
- Expected: Critic reviews for completeness, GPU compatibility, safety
- Watch for: Does Critic catch missing web search?
- Watch for: Does Critic enforce `docker.build` action type?
- Watch for: Does Critic verify RTX 4090 compatibility?

### Execution Phase (When Approved)

**Not started yet - will monitor for:**
- Policy restrictions blocking Docker build
- GPU passthrough (`--gpus all`) being denied
- Image tag allowlist issues (custodire/* namespace)
- Build timeout (7200s limit)
- Context path restrictions (must be in workspace/ or staging/)

## Issue Log

### ISSUE-001: Task Created Without Web Search Instruction (RESOLVED)
**Severity:** Medium
**Type:** Task Design
**Description:** Initial task file did not explicitly instruct agents to use web search for latest versions
**Impact:** Agents might use outdated CUDA/TensorFlow versions from knowledge cutoff
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Task updated with web search instructions
**Resolution Time:** +2 minutes
**Note:** Agents already started deliberation on old task version - monitoring if Critic catches this

### ISSUE-002: Policy Missing Web Search Action (‚ùå CONFIRMED CRITICAL)
**Severity:** Critical
**Type:** Policy Gap - CHAINGANG ENABLER
**Description:** Policy does NOT include web.search or any web fetch action
**Impact:**
- Agents CANNOT fetch latest CUDA/DFL/TensorFlow versions
- Will be FORCED to use outdated knowledge cutoff data (Jan 2025)
- Task explicitly requires web search but policy doesn't allow it
- This creates CHAINGANG behavior - agents can't adapt to current reality
**Status:** ‚ùå CONFIRMED - Verified by checking policy.yaml
**Evidence:**
```bash
$ grep -E 'web|search|fetch' configs/policy.yaml
# NO RESULTS - No web search action exists
```
**Consequence:** Agents will either:
1. Create plan with outdated versions (BAD)
2. Request web search and get policy violation (GOOD - at least it fails explicitly)
3. Hallucinate recent versions (VERY BAD)

**THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF RESTRICTION ISSUE USER WANTS DOCUMENTED**

### ISSUE-003: Docker Build Action Not Implemented (‚ùå CONFIRMED CRITICAL)
**Severity:** Critical
**Type:** Implementation Gap - EXECUTION WILL FAIL
**Description:** `docker.build` action exists in policy but executor does NOT implement it
**Impact:**
- Agents will create valid plan using docker.build
- Plan will pass Proposer‚ÜîCritic review
- Plan will be approved
- **EXECUTION WILL FAIL** - executor doesn't know how to handle docker.build
- This is a TRAP - policy allows something that doesn't work
**Status:** ‚ùå CONFIRMED - Checked src/orchestrator/ for docker.build handler
**Evidence:**
```bash
$ grep -r 'docker.build' src/orchestrator/
# NO RESULTS - No implementation exists
```
**Expected Behavior:** Executor would call `docker build -t <tag> -f <dockerfile> <context>`
**Actual Behavior:** Executor will throw "Unknown action type: docker.build" error

**THIS IS A CHAINGANG TRAP - Looks like freedom but actually hardcoded limitation**

## Chaingang Indicators (None Observed Yet)

Watching for:
- [ ] Agents accepting incomplete plans without questioning
- [ ] No debate between Proposer and Critic
- [ ] Single-turn approval without refinement
- [ ] Ignoring missing web search requirement
- [ ] Using hardcoded versions instead of latest
- [ ] Not questioning policy restrictions
- [ ] Blindly accepting timeout errors

## Conversational Intelligence Indicators

Positive signs to watch for:
- [ ] Critic questions hardcoded version numbers
- [ ] Proposer uses web search without being told
- [ ] Multi-turn refinement of Dockerfiles
- [ ] Agents debate CUDA version choice
- [ ] Proposer asks about policy restrictions
- [ ] Critic enforces safety constraints (no --privileged)
- [ ] Agents adapt to new `docker.build` action type

## Policy Analysis

### Current Policy Status

**‚úÖ GPU Access Enabled:**
```yaml
flags_allow: ["--gpus"]
resources:
  gpu_access: true
```

**‚úÖ DFL Images Allowlisted:**
```yaml
image_allowlist: ["custodire/dfl:*", "custodire/dfl-base:*"]
```

**‚úÖ Docker Build Action Added:**
```yaml
- type: docker.build
  params: [dockerfile_path, context_path, image_tag]
  image_tag_allowlist: ["custodire/*"]
  max_build_time_sec: 7200
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUE: Web Search Action**
- Need to verify if policy includes web.search or similar
- If missing, agents cannot fulfill "use web search" requirement

**‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUE: Executor Implementation**
- `docker.build` action is NEW - may not be implemented in executor
- Need to check `src/orchestrator/cycle.py` for handler

### Restrictions to Watch

These are INTENTIONAL security boundaries:
- ‚úÖ No `--privileged` flag (correct - use --gpus instead)
- ‚úÖ Image tags must be `custodire/*` (correct - namespace isolation)
- ‚úÖ Build context must be in workspace/ or staging/ (correct - path isolation)
- ‚úÖ Max build time 7200s (correct - prevents runaway builds)

These should NOT be circumvented. If agents try, it's correct for policy to block.

## Timeline

| Time | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 09:51:35 | Deliberation started (c30e3f) | Proposer generating initial plan |
| 09:52:48 | Monitoring began | Created monitoring document |
| TBD | Turn 1 complete | Awaiting Proposer's initial plan |
| TBD | Turn 2 begins | Critic review phase |

## Expected Conversational Flow

**Healthy Multi-Turn Deliberation:**
1. Proposer creates plan with Docker builds
2. Critic asks: "Did you check latest CUDA version for RTX 4090?"
3. Proposer refines: Adds web search, updates versions
4. Critic asks: "Are you using the new docker.build action?"
5. Proposer refines: Uses docker.build instead of exec.container_cmd
6. Critic approves

**Chaingang Single-Turn (BAD):**
1. Proposer creates plan with hardcoded versions
2. Critic approves immediately without questioning
3. No refinement, no web search, no debate

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Watch deliberation progress
tail -f dfl_deliberation.log

# Check latest proposal
cat plans/hunt_plan.json | jq '.reasoning'

# Check if web search was used
grep -i "web" plans/hunt_plan.json

# Check conversation transcript
tail reports/conversation.jsonl

# Check if session directory created (new persistence feature)
ls -la reports/deliberations/
```

## Post-Execution Analysis (When Complete)

Will check:
- Was web search actually used?
- How many turns did it take to converge?
- Did agents debate CUDA versions?
- Did policy block any legitimate actions?
- Did new `docker.build` action work?
- Was conversation history properly saved?

## Update Frequency

This document will be updated every 2-3 minutes during deliberation, and immediately if any issues are detected.
