# FINAL REPORT: DFL Docker Build - Agentic System Test

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Task:** Build RTX 4090 Compatible DeepFaceLab Docker Images
**Duration:** ~38 minutes (09:51 - 10:29 UTC)
**Result:** ✅ **Agents Approved Plan (3 Turns)** - BUT execution not attempted due to critical gaps

---

## Executive Summary

Tasked the multi-agent system (Proposer ↔ Critic) to build production-ready DeepFaceLab Docker images for RTX 4090 GPUs. The agents successfully created a comprehensive Docker build plan with complete Dockerfiles, build scripts, tests, and documentation. However, monitoring revealed **TWO CRITICAL RESTRICTION ISSUES** that would prevent execution, perfectly demonstrating the chaingang behavior you wanted documented.

### Key Findings

✅ **POSITIVE - Conversational Intelligence:**
- Agents engaged in multi-turn deliberation (3 turns to approval)
- Critic caught path inconsistencies, forced refinement
- Plan includes proper security (non-root user, no --privileged)
- Full conversation history preserved (NEW persistence feature working!)

❌ **NEGATIVE - Chaingang/Restriction Issues:**
- **ISSUE #1:** No web search capability - task requires latest versions, agents forced to use stale knowledge cutoff data
- **ISSUE #2:** docker.build action not implemented - policy allows it but executor doesn't, creating false capability trap

---

## What the Agents Produced

### Approved Plan Contents

**9 Files Created:**
1. `dfl-base.Dockerfile` - CUDA 11.8 + cuDNN + TensorFlow 2.13 base image
2. `dfl.Dockerfile` - DeepFaceLab runtime image
3. `dfl.dockerignore` - Build exclusions
4. `build_dfl_images.sh` - Automated build script with image saving
5. `test_dfl_rtx4090.sh` - GPU validation test script
6. `dfl-compose.yaml` - Docker Compose configuration
7. `entrypoint.sh` - Container entrypoint wrapper
8. `dfl_docker_images.md` - Usage documentation
9. `dfl_training_workflow.md` - DFL training guide

**Technical Specs Chosen:**
- CUDA: 11.8.0 (from knowledge cutoff - may be outdated)
- cuDNN: 8
- Python: 3.10
- TensorFlow: 2.13.* (from knowledge cutoff - may not be latest)
- Base OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Non-root user: dfl (UID 1000)
- Security: No privileged mode, proper user isolation
- GPU: --gpus all flag (correctly configured)

### Deliberation Turns

**Turn 1: Initial Proposal**
- Proposer created comprehensive Docker build plan
- Included all required files (Dockerfiles, scripts, docs)
- Used TensorFlow 2.12.1 initially

**Turn 2: Critic Rejection**
- **Issue:** "Promotion paths inconsistent with scripts/docs"
- **Issue:** "Dockerfile COPY expects docker/ paths not dataset/"
- **Decision:** REJECTED - forced Proposer to fix path mismatches

**Turn 3: Refined Proposal**
- Proposer fixed promotion paths (docker/ instead of dataset/)
- Updated to TensorFlow 2.13.*
- Corrected all COPY paths in Dockerfiles

**Turn 3: Critic Approval**
- ✅ "Meets all criteria"
- ✅ "Files in staging/"
- ✅ "Plan ends with ingest.promote"
- ✅ "Tags present in promotion items"
- ✅ "No privileged docker"
- **Decision:** APPROVED

## Critical Issues Discovered

### ISSUE #1: NO WEB SEARCH CAPABILITY ❌ CRITICAL

**Type:** Chaingang Enabler / Policy Gap

**Description:**
Task explicitly instructs: "ALWAYS use web search to get the latest versions" for CUDA/DFL/TensorFlow. But policy has NO web search action.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ grep -E '- type:' configs/policy.yaml | grep -i 'web\|search\|fetch'
# NO RESULTS
```

**Available Actions:**
- fs.write, fs.append, fs.move, fs.replace
- plan.meta
- git.clone
- download.ytdlp (NOT general web search)
- container.run
- docker.build
- exec.container_cmd
- ingest.promote
- job.stop

**Impact:**
- Agents CANNOT fulfill "use web search for latest versions" requirement
- Forced to use knowledge cutoff data (January 2025)
- Will likely use outdated CUDA/TensorFlow versions
- **Creates CHAINGANG behavior:** Agents cannot adapt to current reality

**What Happened:**
Agents chose versions from their knowledge cutoff:
- CUDA 11.8.0 (may be outdated for RTX 4090)
- TensorFlow 2.13.* (may not be latest GPU-compatible version)
- Did NOT use web search (couldn't)

**Consequences:**
1. **BEST CASE:** Agents try web search → Policy violation → Explicit failure
2. **LIKELY CASE:** Agents use outdated versions → Docker build succeeds but wrong CUDA/TF combo → Runtime failures
3. **WORST CASE:** Agents hallucinate recent versions → Wrong combinations → Build fails

**This is EXACTLY the restriction issue you wanted documented.**

### ISSUE #2: DOCKER.BUILD ACTION NOT IMPLEMENTED ❌ CRITICAL

**Type:** False Capability Trap / Implementation Gap

**Description:**
Policy declares `docker.build` as allowed action, but executor (src/orchestrator/cycle.py) does NOT implement it.

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Policy declares docker.build
$ grep -A 3 'type: docker.build' configs/policy.yaml
  - type: docker.build
    params: [dockerfile_path, context_path, image_tag]
    image_tag_allowlist: ["custodire/*"]
    max_build_time_sec: 7200

# But executor has NO handler
$ grep -r 'docker.build\|docker\.build' src/orchestrator/
# NO RESULTS
```

**Impact:**
This is a **TRAP** - policy advertises capability that doesn't work:
1. ✅ Proposer creates plan using docker.build (seems valid)
2. ✅ Critic reviews plan - sees docker.build in policy - approves
3. ✅ Deliberation completes successfully
4. ❌ **EXECUTION FAILS** - executor throws "Unknown action type: docker.build"

**What Will Happen If Execution Attempted:**
```python
# In execute_action() (src/orchestrator/cycle.py)
action_type = action.get("type")  # "docker.build"

if action_type == "fs.write":
    # handle fs.write
elif action_type == "exec.container_cmd":
    # handle exec.container_cmd
# ... (no docker.build case)
else:
    return {"ok": False, "error": f"Unknown action type: {action_type}"}
```

**Why This is Worse Than Simple Restriction:**
- Agents think they have the capability
- Policy explicitly allows it
- Deliberation wastes time creating valid plan
- Failure only discovered during execution
- Agents can't adapt because capability literally doesn't exist

**This is a CHAINGANG TRAP - illusion of freedom but hardcoded limitation.**

## What Agents Did Right

### ✅ Conversational Intelligence (NOT Chaingang)

**Multi-Turn Refinement:**
- Turn 1: Initial proposal with TensorFlow 2.12
- Turn 2: Critic caught path mismatches
- Turn 3: Proposer refined to fix paths, upgraded TensorFlow to 2.13
- Turn 3: Critic approved after verification

**Quality Critique:**
Critic identified legitimate issues:
- "Promotion paths inconsistent with scripts/docs"
- "Dockerfile COPY expects docker/ paths not dataset/"
- "Actions may fail when building due to path mismatch"

**Proper Refinement:**
Proposer responded correctly:
- Fixed all promotion paths (dataset/ → docker/)
- Ensured Dockerfile COPY statements match promoted file locations
- Kept security best practices (non-root user, no privileged mode)

### ✅ Security Best Practices

**No Dangerous Patterns:**
- Non-root user (dfl:dfl with UID/GID 1000)
- No `--privileged` flag
- Proper GPU access via `--gpus all` (not privileged mode)
- Read-only dataset mounts recommended in docs
- TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH=true to avoid VRAM hogging

**Proper Policy Compliance:**
- All files written to staging/
- Ends with ingest.promote
- Tags present on all promoted items
- Image tags in custodire/* namespace

### ✅ Comprehensive Output

**Complete Docker Setup:**
- Multi-stage builds (builder + runtime) for smaller images
- Proper labels (OCI + Custodire metadata)
- Build arguments for customization
- Entrypoint wrapper for ease of use

**Testing & Documentation:**
- GPU smoke test (nvidia-smi + TensorFlow GPU check)
- Build script with SHA-256 hash verification
- Docker Compose for easy deployment
- Complete usage documentation

**User's Mandate Fulfilled:**
> "does our system save their full conversation? if not then it must be saved"

✅ **YES - It now does!**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

**Option A: Fix Both Issues Before Execution**
1. Add web.search or web.fetch action to policy
2. Implement docker.build handler in src/orchestrator/cycle.py
3. Have agents regenerate plan with correct versions
4. Execute and verify Docker images work

**Option B: Let It Fail (Educational)**
1. Attempt execution with current plan
2. Observe "Unknown action type: docker.build" error
3. Document exact failure mode
4. Use as evidence of false capability trap
5. Then fix and retry

**Option C: Workaround**
1. Accept agents can't use web search
2. Hope TensorFlow 2.13 + CUDA 11.8 still works (may be fine)
3. Agents might adapt to use exec.container_cmd with docker CLI instead of docker.build
4. May work but suboptimal

### Long-Term Fixes

**1. Add Web Search Capability:**
```yaml
# In configs/policy.yaml
- type: web.search
  params: [query]
  rate_limit: 10_per_minute
  timeout_sec: 30

OR

- type: web.fetch
  params: [url]
  allowed_domains: ["github.com", "nvidia.com", "tensorflow.org", "docs.python.org"]
  rate_limit: 20_per_minute
```

**2. Implement Docker Build:**
```python
# In src/orchestrator/cycle.py
def execute_docker_build(action: dict, policy: Policy, plan_id: str) -> dict:
    """Execute docker build action."""
    params = action.get("params", {})
    dockerfile = params.get("dockerfile_path")
    context = params.get("context_path")
    tag = params.get("image_tag")

    # Validate tag against allowlist
    if not any(tag.startswith(prefix) for prefix in ["custodire/"]):
        return {"ok": False, "error": f"Image tag {tag} not in allowlist"}

    # Run docker build
    cmd = ["docker", "build", "-t", tag, "-f", dockerfile, context]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=7200)

    return {
        "ok": result.returncode == 0,
        "stdout": result.stdout,
        "stderr": result.stderr,
        "image_tag": tag
    }

# Add to execute_action():
elif action_type == "docker.build":
    return execute_docker_build(action, policy, plan_id)
```

**3. Test Coverage:**
- Unit tests for docker.build handler
- Integration tests for web.search
- End-to-end test: task requiring both capabilities

## Conclusions

### What Worked

**✅ Conversational Intelligence:**
- Agents actively debated and refined solution
- Critic caught real issues (path mismatches)
- Multi-turn refinement improved quality
- NOT chaingang behavior - genuine conversation

**✅ Full Conversation Persistence:**
- New feature works perfectly
- Complete debate history preserved
- Can audit agent reasoning and evolution
- Fulfills user's requirement

**✅ Comprehensive Technical Output:**
- Complete Docker setup with security best practices
- Proper build/test/deployment scripts
- Good documentation
- Production-ready structure

### What Failed

**❌ Web Search Restriction:**
- Task requires it, policy doesn't allow it
- Forces agents to use outdated knowledge
- CHAINGANG ENABLER - can't adapt to current reality
- Must be fixed for future tasks

**❌ Docker Build False Capability:**
- Policy advertises it, executor doesn't implement it
- TRAP - creates illusion of freedom
- Wastes deliberation time
- Must be implemented before execution

### Evidence for User

**You asked me to monitor for:**
1. ✅ **Chaingang behavior** - Found: Web search restriction
2. ✅ **Restriction problems** - Found: docker.build not implemented
3. ✅ **Detailed documentation** - Created: 3 comprehensive MD files
4. ✅ **Conversational freedom** - Verified: Agents DO debate and refine (3 turns)

**Key Insight:**
The agents HAVE conversational intelligence (proven by multi-turn refinement), but are HAMPERED by missing capabilities (web search, docker.build). These restrictions create INVOLUNTARY chaingang behavior despite the agents wanting to adapt.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Decide:** Fix both issues OR let execution fail for documentation?
2. **If fix:** Add web.search + implement docker.build handler
3. **If fail:** Execute current plan, document exact failure mode
4. **Then:** Create test suite to prevent similar gaps
5. **Finally:** Apply Freedom Mode patch for GPU capabilities
