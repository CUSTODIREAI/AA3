Using Ubuntu 22.04 aligns with Python 3.10 and modern CUDA images. Pinning exact versions based on current web data prevents common 4090 breakages from mismatched TF/CUDA/cuDNN. Validating via scripted GPU checks and a minimal DFL pipeline ensures practical readiness beyond just import success. Multi-stage builds with non-root users and dockerignore reduce image size and risk.
