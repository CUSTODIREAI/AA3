It's important to specify variables instead of hard-coding values. The actions need concrete parameters, though as a proposer, I might be able to use environment variables or references. I’ll create files like \"staging/test-delib-001.txt\" and add metadata tags. I'll promote the files in an append-only manner, making sure to include uniqueness and some sample content.\n**Clarifying promotion guidelines**\n\nI need to ensure an append-only promotion for my files. The tool `ingest.promote` should handle appending to the manifest, and to mimic the ledger, I can add `fs.append` to a ledger file in the dataset. However, the policy indicates I shouldn't write directly to the dataset; I'll keep writes to the staging area only. It's fine to avoid using containers unless necessary. I should use `ingest.promote` with the \"append\" parameter for the promotion process.\n**Crafting file creation plan**\n\nI'm defining paths for my project, including a staging directory at \"staging/deliberation_test\" and a dataset directory at \"dataset/deliberation_test.\" I'll create three files named \"test_a.txt,\" \"test_b.txt,\" and \"test_c.txt\" in the staging area, with corresponding destination paths in the dataset. Each file will have specific content and metadata tags, including file_id, data_type, and campaign. I'll ensure every file has unique tags like \"variant\" or \"purpose,\" and I need to present them clearly, possibly as a structured object or list for safety.\n**Defining metadata for files**\n\nI need to set up metadata for my files with a unique identifier, data type, and campaign name \"deliberation_test.\" My metadata will include a \"file_id,\" a \"data_type\" that specifies the type of test data, and the campaign name. To ensure uniqueness, I can vary the data_type with options like \"test/smoke,\" \"test/sanity,\" and \"test/regression.\" Each of these will have unique metadata tags. My next actions will involve writing the files and considering running an ingestion promotion with the items mapped appropriately.\n**Preparing actions list for file management**\n\nI’m going to specify the actions for my file management process. First, I’ll set up the items array, including the source and destination paths along with metadata for promotion. I don’t think we need a separate step for moving files since `fs.write` should handle that. I’ll include an `exec.container_cmd` action to ensure directories exist, but I suspect it's better to rely solely on `fs.write`. Next, I’ll compile actions for writing the files, ensuring they’re tagged properly and ready for promotion with append-only settings. Let's structure that as JSON.\n[2025-10-28T18:12:04] codex\n**Clarifying promotion guidelines**\n\nI need to ensure an append-only promotion for my files.
