  "approach": "Implement an iterative factorial with input validation, document via doctest examples, and provide a small unittest suite executed under __main__.",
  "steps": [
    "Define iterative factorial function",
    "Validate input and raise ValueError for negatives",
    "Add type hints and concise docstring",
    "Include doctest examples for 0, 1, 5, and error",
    "Write unittest cases for typical and edge inputs",
    "Add __main__ block to run doctest and unittests"
  ],
  "unknowns": [
    "Expected Python version (assume Python 3.8+)",
    "Whether non-integer inputs should raise TypeError or be coerced",
    "Any upper bound or performance constraints for large n",
    "Preferred testing style (unittest vs. pytest) and verbosity",
    "File/module naming convention and repository location"
  ],
  "rationale": "An iterative implementation avoids recursion depth limits and is easy to read and test. Explicit input validation meets the negative-number requirement and prevents silent errors. Doctest examples double as documentation and quick verification, while a minimal unittest suite provides reliable regression checks for edge cases. Running both under __main__ keeps the script self-contained and simple to execute without external tooling."
