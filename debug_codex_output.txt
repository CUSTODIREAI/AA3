You are a Proposer agent creating a plan for dataset curation.

TASK:
# Task: Simple Test Ingest

## Goal
Test the multi-agent deliberation system with a minimal task: create 3 test files in staging and promote them to the dataset with proper tagging.

## Success Criteria
- Create 3 text files in `staging/test/` with different content
- Each file should have unique metadata (different tags)
- Promote all files to `dataset/` via `ingest.promote` (append-only)
- Files must be tagged with:
  - `test_id`: unique identifier
  - `content_type`: type of test data
  - `phase`: "deliberation_test"

## Constraints
- Tools-only (use gateway actions from configs/policy.yaml)
- No privileged Docker
- Dataset is append-only via `ingest.promote`
- Files must land in `staging/test/` first, then promote
- Total size: <1KB per file (keep it tiny)

## Expected Output
After execution:
- `staging/test/test_001.txt` → `dataset/YYYY/MM/DD/test/test_001.txt`
- `staging/test/test_002.txt` → `dataset/YYYY/MM/DD/test/test_002.txt`
- `staging/test/test_003.txt` → `dataset/YYYY/MM/DD/test/test_003.txt`
- Manifest entries in `dataset/.manifests/dataset_manifest.jsonl`
- Ledger shows successful execution


HISTORY:
This is your first turn.

PHASE: initial proposal

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations) with this structure:
{
  "plan_id": "unique-id-string",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of approach",
  "actions": [
    {"id": "A1", "type": "fs.write", "params": {"path": "...", "content": "..."}},
    {"id": "A2", "type": "ingest.promote", "items": [{"src": "...", "relative_dst": "...", "tags": {...}}]}
  ]
}

Available tools: fs.write, fs.append, fs.move, git.clone, download.ytdlp, container.run, exec.container_cmd, ingest.promote

Rules:
- Files must be created in staging/ or workspace/ first
- Use ingest.promote to move to dataset/ (append-only)
- Include tags in promotion items
- plan_id must be unique

Output JSON now:

**Planning file actions**

I need to ensure the file size is under 1KB and include small content lines. My plan is to incorporate three fs.write actions along with one ingest.promote action that bundles three items. I’ll ensure the path format is correct, like `staging/test/test_001.txt`, and generate a unique plan_id using a timestamp or UUID. Also, tags must include unique test_id, content_type, and phase marked as "deliberation_test." I’ll just focus on using the necessary tools and produce JSON.
**Creating JSON plan**

I'm crafting a plan with a unique plan_id like "simple-test-ingest-<random>" or something like "st-ingest-9f6a0db3". My reasoning will include a brief explanation. 

I’ll create actions for three fs.write commands, specifying paths and content for each file, followed by one ingest.promote action that bundles the three items properly. I have to use consistent values and double-check my JSON formatting to ensure everything is correct. I need to remember that the total file size must be under 1KB and avoid trailing commas.
**Finalizing JSON plan**

I realize that the developer guidance about "preamble messages before tool calls" doesn’t apply since I’m only outputting the plan JSON and not executing any tool calls. I’m finalizing my JSON now and won’t include any unnecessary tags, like "source": "proposer," since they weren't requested. 

To ensure uniqueness, I’ll go with the plan_id "plan-simple-test-ingest-7c3b8a2f" and add a reasoning string. Now, let’s create the final output!
